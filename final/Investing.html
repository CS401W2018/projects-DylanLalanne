            <p> It's important to understand that inflation significantly impacts 
                your earnings over time. Suppose the example above, you contribute $500 monthly
                over 30 years, you'll end up with $290,000. But your real return 
                on is closer to $180,000 once you adjust for 3% 
                inflation. Historically, inflation has averaged around 3.1% over the
                past century, so to measure true growth, we have to consider the 
                real value of money, not just the nominal increases.where Inflation rate is greater than the nominal interest rate,  What seems 
                like growth is actually a loss in real purchasing power.
                In an economists perspective, the borrow is actually the one who wins if the 
                inflation is greater than the interest rate. Simply put - when you invest you 
                are the loaner, whose gain is less than the depreciation of the currency in terms 
                of real purchasing power.

                Bond yields,however work differently, they typically sit 1-2% above inflation,
                are seen as a safer hedgeâ€” than traditional investing, your returns are guranteed 
                unless the government defaults on their loan-highly unlikey. Bonds help preserve your wealth. 
                In contrast, most savings accounts offer returns 
                as low as 0.1%, meaning your money is effectively shrinking every 
                year by amount in account - (loss of inflation + .1%)x amount in account, while banks reinvest it for their own profit.
