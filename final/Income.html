        <h2> The most important factor in gaining financial freedom: Income:  </h1>
            <p>It is infinitely easier to gain wealth through work than it is through investing,
            when the amount of money in your investments average yearly gain + divedends cannot 
            cover your expenses this indicates that you need constant cash flow just like every other american
            whos not an anomoly. 
        
            Suppose you earn 60,000$ annually,
             and you save 500$ a month, an increase in 10,000 what is the first the you'll do.
            If your like most people you'll spend more the following year and probably not increase 
            savings all that much, however if you were to increase savings by the amount of your gain
            the rate at which you gain financial freedom increase exponentially due to compounding. 
            Understanding compounding is the key to gain wealth vs lose it.
