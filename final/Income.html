        <h2> The most important factor in gaining financial freedom: Income:  </h1>
            <p>It is infinitely easier to gain wealth through work than it is through investing,
            when the amount of money in your investments average yearly gain + divedends cannot 
            cover your expenses this indicates that you need constant cash flow just like every other american
            whos not an anomoly. 
        
            Suppose you earn 60,000$ annually,
             and you save 500$ a month, an increase in 10,000 what is the first the you'll do.
            If your like most people you'll spend more the following year and probably not increase 
            savings all that much, however if you were to increase savings by the amount of your gain
            the rate at which you gain financial freedom increase exponentially, but that only happens 
            when you make money. We call this type of money, money that you are free to invest disposable income,
            its the income that you have after all of your basic needes are met. Most people don't invest their disposable
            income, they perfer to spend it, which is fine, but it inhibits their 
            ability to become financially secure, financially free. Due to this it's important to pursue paths which will 
            increase your income. This includes, education, learning tradecraft, or any other means where you gain an income 
            for the work that you do.
