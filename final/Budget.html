        <h1> How to create and maintain a budget</h1>
            <p> On our investing page, we outline how important it is to
                 invest more money into your account, but how can you actually do that in 
                your situation, everyone is different. Some of us will be able to save much
                more than others, ultimately it is primarily dependant on one feature
                your ability to stick to a budget.
            
                Many people follow the 50 30 20 rule,
                 50% of your paycheck - needs, 30% - wants, 20% - savings.
                Other models can be a bit more complex, so lets keep it very simple.
