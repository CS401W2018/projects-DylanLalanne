         <h1> Questions </h1> <p>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?
         Blocks form a box and want to take the whole width, and its height is only as high as necessary. Inline tags cause no line breaks. 
        What is the margin, border, and padding?
        Margin = Outside, Padding moves content away from border, Border = the edge. 
        What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?
        Pixels, Percentages, in, cm, pt, em, rem, vw, vh, vmin, vmax.
        When would you use a figure tag?
        Use it for photos, videos, graphs, diagrams. You can have a caption but you still need alt text.
