    <header> <h1> Brawl Stars </h1> </header>
    <main>
<h2> Controls & Enviroment </h2>
<p> Within Brawl Stars there are two three simple joysticks and one button. 
    The left joystick allows player to move in desired direction, and the two joysticks on the right, one for base attack and one for special ability called 'super'. 
    Above these joysticks on the right side is a button called gadet which activates at the press of a button. Note: Mant gadgets change nature of base attack, such that use of gadget will be upon next base attack after the button is pressed. 
    In the enviroment there are breakable walls that base attacks can't penetrate, water which most brawlers can't enter, and unbreakable walls. </p>
<h2> Unique Charaters traits & Abilities </h2>
    <p>Each Brawler has 5 Important traits, Ammo reload speed, ammo capacity, movement speed, health, super charge rate, and many brawlers have special traits, such as a tank trait inwhich the brawler charges his/her super when attacked. In addition to base differences the nature of each brawler is different, having different attacks, supers, and gadgets. Though brawlers can be divided into classes such as sharpshooter, assassin, etc each brawler is completly unique. 
    </p>
<h2> Objectives & Synergy </h2>
<p> The objective in the game depends on which game mode you are playing, for example you could play 3v3 which is more standard for most players, or showdown in which when you in solos, or team in duos is eliminated your out. 
    Focusing on 3v3 modes is usually the most strategic/competitive mode, meaning it is important to communicate and understand your role in your teams composition. 
    It is unwise to play 3 sharshooters on most maps even if its your best brawlers because they can be easily countered on most maps by throwers who can attack over walls. Thus enters the important decision of developing a team which works well together. 
    Additionaly, it is unwise even with good team synergy to play a tank/healer team into a tank counter team, even the best players often lose to less talented players when countered.
